# covidMap
view at: https://gkolli.github.io/covidMap/

This is a simple web-app that visualizes COVID-19 cases in every county across the USA, over time. The data is pulled from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2019-nCoV Data Repository. This site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the D3 and topoJSON libraries, and it was my final project for a data visualization course.
